Have you ever had a craving for a certain food just to be overwhelmed by the
number of of options for it? 

Indecisiveness can be a serious battle for those with mental health conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or depression. 

If experiencing indecisiveness is a constant source of stress and anxiety, you're not alone.
To aid fellow students in what psychologists call "choice overload," we created the best website for those that struggle with food-indecisiveness.
Type "pasta", "burger", "fries",.. Whatever you want, we'll get you a single recipe using, TheMealDB: An open, crowd-sourced database of Recipes from around the world.

We understand the difficulty of taking care of yourself--Especially when it comes to food. When there are too many similar options, our brains have a hard time making a decision.

If you'd prefer not to read, a youtube video is pre-linked as well!

Good luck, have fun, and stay safe!
